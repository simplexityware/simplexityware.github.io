**Thesis Proposal: Alpha Expression Generation with Fine-Tuned Transformers**

**Title:**  **Generating Viable Alpha Expressions using Fine-Tuned Transformers Trained on Elementary Cellular Automata**

**Abstract:**

This research proposes a novel approach to generating viable trading signals, known as "alpha expressions," by leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on data generated by Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA). Unlike conventional methods relying on statistical models, this research uses ECA as an intermediate representation space, encoding financial data and operators to generate complex patterns. An LLM is then trained to not only recognize patterns but to generate novel expressions representing potentially profitable trading strategies. This approach aims to uncover non-obvious market signals, combining theoretical insights from algorithmic information theory and complex systems with deep learning.

**1. Introduction**

The pursuit of consistent profitability in financial markets hinges on identifying reliable trading signals, known as "alpha." Traditional methods, based on statistical modeling and econometrics, often struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of market dynamics. This research shifts the paradigm by exploring the use of algorithmic rule-based systems, specifically Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA), to encode financial information. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that uses a transformer-based large language model (LLM) trained on complex ECA systems as pattern generators that can generate non-trivial expressions for viable alphas.

**2. Background and Significance**

*   **Limitations of Traditional Alpha Generation:** Current approaches often rely on curve-fitting, spurious correlations, and may not capture underlying system dynamics, leading to fragile or overfitted strategies.
*   **Algorithmic Information Theory and Complex Systems:** These perspectives suggest market behavior can be better understood as emergent phenomena driven by rule-based interactions.
*   **Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA):** ECAs, with their ability to generate diverse patterns from simple rules, provide a good basis to explore algorithmic rule-based behavior and can be used to represent financial data and operators.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Rule-Based Pattern Generation:** We propose that a transformer based LLM, pre-trained on complex ECA systems, can act as powerful pattern *generators* in the ECA-encoded space, creating novel combinations of operators and data fields with alpha potential.

**3. Hypothesis**

By representing financial data and operators as states and rules within ECAs, and training a transformer-based LLM on complex ECA dynamics, the LLM can generate novel, viable alpha expressions when prompted with specific ECA configurations. These alpha expressions can then be decoded to represent potentially profitable trading signals.

**4. Research Objectives**

1.  **Develop a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Alpha Expressions:** Define a formal language encompassing data fields (tickers, timeframes, price data, volume data, etc.), operators (moving average, rank, diff, correlation, etc.), and logical conditions, which define the rules of your trading strategies
2.  **Create an ECA Encoding Scheme:** Develop and implement a robust methodology for mapping data fields and operators from the DSL to ECA initial states and local rules. This must handle both static and time-series data.
3.  **Pre-train an LLM on Complex ECAs:** Adapt and train a transformer-based LLM on a large dataset of ECA trajectories generated from complex ECA rules (as in the original paper). The focus should be on its ability to capture the complex temporal dynamics of ECA systems.
4.  **Fine-tune the LLM for Alpha Expression Generation:** Fine-tune the pre-trained LLM, using generated superimposed ECA patterns as input, to predict the configurations of new ECAs or even the rules and the initial states of the ECAs that correspond to a profitable trading signal, as determined by an external profitability metric. This fine-tuning will be performed using ECA configurations mapped to alpha expressions of the DSL.
5.  **Develop a "Decoding" Mechanism:** Implement a reliable method to map generated ECA configurations back into their corresponding alpha expressions using the DSL.
6.  **Validate Generated Alpha Expressions:** Evaluate the generated alphas through rigorous backtesting and statistical analysis, assessing metrics such as Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and robustness across diverse market conditions and time periods.
7.  **Analyze, Interpret, and Improve Alpha Expressions:** Use causal decomposition techniques (like those from previous proposal) to understand the driving forces of the successful trading strategies. Use this understanding to further improve the LLM.

**5. Methodology**

*   **DSL Design:** Design a flexible DSL to represent trading strategies as composable combinations of data fields and operators, with logical if-then-else blocks.
*   **ECA Encoding:**
    *   **Data Field Encoding:** Implement a mapping from financial data to binary ECA states. Evaluate different encoding methods (thresholding, quantization, fourier, etc.).
    *   **Operator Encoding:** Develop a scheme to transform ECA rules in a way that they transform their respective data fields.
    *  **Superimposition of ECAs:** Define a way to combine different ECAs so that their joint signal corresponds to complex trading strategies
*   **LLM Pretraining:** Use the GPT-2 architecture with adaptations for binary sequences. Train on a massive dataset of randomly generated ECA sequences from different complexity regimes.
*   **LLM Fine-tuning:** The model will be prompted with ECA patterns that, after being decoded and tested, generate potentially profitable trading strategies. The LLM will be fine-tuned to predict these patterns.
*   **Decoding and Alpha Generation:** Use a deterministic or probabilistic mapping scheme from ECA states and rules back to DSL expressions. Apply post-generation constraints to ensure viability.
*   **Validation:** Conduct backtesting on out-of-sample historical data, evaluating risk-adjusted returns and other performance metrics.

**6. Expected Outcomes and Impact**

1.  **Functional Alpha Expression Generation System:** Produce a system capable of autonomously generating novel, viable alpha expressions.
2.  **Demonstration of LLMs for Algorithm Discovery:** Demonstrate that LLMs can not only *learn* but *create* novel algorithms (trading strategies) through their exploration of ECA-encoded spaces.
3.  **New Insights into Market Dynamics:** Discover previously unknown relationships between complex market patterns and underlying algorithmic rules.
4.  **Contribution to Algorithmic Trading:** Develop new methodologies for alpha discovery in algorithmic trading.
5.  **Provide a General Framework:** Provide a framework for algorithmic discovery in other time series analysis problems

**7. Timeline:**

*   **Months 1-3:** Define DSL, implement ECA encoding, set up infrastructure.
*   **Months 4-6:** LLM pretraining, experiment with different complex ECA regimes
*  **Months 7-9:**  Develop fine-tuning methodology for LLM, develop decoding mechanism
*   **Months 10-12:** Backtesting, statistical validation, refine the system.

**8. Conclusion**

This research seeks to push the boundaries of alpha generation by using sophisticated pattern recognition and generation capabilities of transformer-based LLMs and encoding financial information using ECAs. It aims to demonstrate that LLMs, when trained on highly complex, algorithmically-generated data, can uncover hidden patterns, create non-obvious rules, and produce potentially profitable trading signals, marking a significant advancement in algorithmic trading and financial time series analysis.

**Key Changes and Improvements from the Previous Proposal:**

*   **Explicit Alpha Focus:** The core objective is now *alpha generation* and the methods are designed to achieve that
*   **Emphasis on the DSL:** Your focus on a domain-specific language will make the generated alphas more relevant.
*   **LLM as Generator:** You emphasize the generative power of the LLM, going beyond just pattern recognition.
*   **Emphasis on "Decoding" and Actionable Results:** The revised proposal highlights decoding the ECA patterns into *actionable* trading strategies
*   **Emphasis on Evaluation:** Now it is clear that generated signals will be tested using real-world backtesting, focusing on risk adjusted returns.

**Next Steps**

3.  **Implement basic tools:** Start with simple implementations to get a first idea of how all the parts fit together.
4.  **Refine the problem.** As you implement and iterate, you might have to refine the problem statement or methodologies that you will be using.
