### Summary of "Dynamical Theory of Complex Systems with Two-Way Microâ€“Macro Causation"  
**From the Perspective of Complexity and Cybernetics**

#### **Overview**  
The paper by Harte et al. (2024) introduces a novel dynamical framework, **Dynamic Maxent across Entwined Scales (DyMES)**, to address the challenges of modeling complex systems where **bidirectional causation** exists between micro- and macro-level dynamics. In traditional complexity science and cybernetics, systems are often studied through either **Bottom-Up mechanistic modeling** (micro-level dynamics driving macro-level outcomes) or **Top-Down statistical inference** (macro-level constraints influencing micro-level behavior). DyMES integrates both approaches, offering a hybrid system that incorporates **feedback across scales** to model and predict the behavior of systems with cross-scale dependencies. The theory leverages **information entropy (Maxent)** and mechanistic transition functions to describe and simulate dynamic, non-equilibrium systems.

#### **Key Contributions to Complexity Science**

1. **Bidirectional Micro-Macro Causation and Scale Entwinement**  
   - Complex systems often exhibit **two-way causation**:  
     - **Micro to Macro (Bottom-Up):** Micro-variables aggregate into macro-level state variables.  
     - **Macro to Micro (Top-Down):** Macro-level state variables influence microscale dynamics.  
   - Examples include:  
     - **Epidemiology:** Disease incidence at the population level (macro) influences individual behavior (micro).  
     - **Economics:** Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP) shape individual financial decisions.  
     - **Ecology:** Population size and species diversity (macro) impact individual growth or reproduction rates.  
   - DyMES formalizes this "entwinement" by explicitly modeling **feedback loops across hierarchical levels**, which is critical for understanding system resilience, adaptability, and emergent behavior.

2. **Dynamic Maxent Framework**  
   - The framework merges **Shannon entropy maximization (Maxent)** with dynamic constraints imposed by time-evolving macro-variables.  
   - Traditional Maxent assumes equilibrium, but DyMES extends it to **non-equilibrium systems** by dynamically updating constraints (state variables and their time derivatives).  
   - Key innovation: **Lagrange multipliers evolve dynamically**, enabling rapid computation of state-variable trajectories even in high-dimensional systems.  

3. **Redefining Feedback in Complex Systems**  
   - In cybernetics, feedback is central to understanding system regulation and stability. DyMES highlights a distinct form of feedback:  
     - **Cross-scale feedback**: Unlike traditional feedback (e.g., between subsystems at the same level), DyMES models interactions **between hierarchical levels** (micro and macro).  
     - This introduces novel dynamics, such as:  
       - **Hysteresis:** Delayed recovery or overshooting when parameters return to initial values.  
       - **Reddened spectra:** Enhanced low-frequency variability in response to stochastic perturbations.  

4. **Dynamic Predictive Power**  
   - DyMES predicts both:  
     - **Macro-variable trajectories** (e.g., population size, economic output).  
     - **Micro-variable distributions** (e.g., income inequality, species abundance).  
   - This enables better modeling of **non-steady-state systems**, where traditional methods (e.g., static Maxent or mechanistic models) fail.

#### **Cybernetics Perspective**
From a cybernetics standpoint, DyMES provides a framework for understanding and managing **adaptive systems** through feedback and information flow at multiple scales. Key cybernetic principles reflected in DyMES include:

1. **Information as a Control Mechanism**  
   - DyMES relies on **Shannon entropy** to encode information about system states. By maximizing entropy, it ensures a "least-biased" distribution of micro-variables consistent with macro-level constraints.  
   - Feedback is regulated by how macro-level information updates micro-level transition functions, effectively creating a cybernetic loop where information governs system behavior.

2. **Self-Organization and Emergence**  
   - The interplay of micro- and macro-level feedback results in emergent behaviors, such as steady-state distributions, oscillations, or hysteresis.  
   - DyMES captures how **local interactions (micro)** combine with **global constraints (macro)** to drive system-level organization.

3. **Resilience and Perturbation Response**  
   - The framework models how systems respond to external disturbances:  
     - Slowed recovery times due to **scale entwinement** (top-down influences).  
     - Nonlinear behaviors and hysteresis caused by delayed feedback loops.  
   - These insights align with cybernetics' focus on system adaptability and robustness under changing conditions.

#### **Applications in Complex Systems**
DyMES is applied to various domains, demonstrating its interdisciplinary scope and relevance to both complexity and cybernetics:

1. **Chemical Thermodynamics**  
   - Models the non-equilibrium distribution of molecular kinetic energies during chemical reactions, accounting for feedback between molecular-scale dynamics and system-level energy changes.

2. **Epidemiology**  
   - Predicts the spread of diseases in social clusters where individual behavior adapts based on macro-level disease prevalence (e.g., public health warnings influencing personal actions).

3. **Economics**  
   - Links income inequality (micro) to national economic growth (macro), showing how policies can influence interdependent patterns of wealth distribution and GDP growth.

4. **Ecology**  
   - Explores population dynamics in ecosystems, emphasizing how **species-level interactions (micro)** and **community-level properties (macro)** co-determine outcomes like biodiversity and resilience to perturbations.

#### **Novel Dynamics Predicted by DyMES**
1. **Hysteresis**  
   - Macro-scale variables may not return to pre-perturbation states even after external conditions are restored, indicating memory-like behavior in complex systems.  

2. **Reddened Time Series Spectra**  
   - DyMES predicts enhanced low-frequency variability in response to white noise, reflecting slower recovery rates and long-term system memory.  

3. **Multiple Steady States**  
   - Systems modeled by DyMES may exhibit distinct steady states based on the interaction of micro- and macro-level dynamics, including states with non-zero Lagrange multipliers.

#### **Implications for Complexity and Cybernetics**
1. **Unified Framework for Multi-Scale Modeling**  
   - DyMES bridges the gap between Bottom-Up (mechanistic) and Top-Down (statistical) approaches by integrating **information-theoretic inference** with **dynamic feedback mechanisms**.  
   - This offers a powerful tool for modeling systems that cannot be fully understood by micro-level or macro-level analysis alone.

2. **Cross-Disciplinary Applicability**  
   - By generalizing concepts like entropy, feedback, and transition functions, DyMES provides a versatile framework for applications in physical, biological, social, and economic systems.

3. **Insights into Resilience and Adaptation**  
   - The framework's ability to predict hysteresis, slow recovery, and emergent variability aligns with cybernetics' emphasis on understanding and managing systems under stress or perturbation.

4. **Tool for Policy and Decision-Making**  
   - DyMES could inform strategies for managing complex systems, such as designing economic policies to reduce inequality or ecological interventions to enhance biodiversity and resilience.

### **Conclusion**
From a complexity and cybernetics perspective, DyMES represents a significant step forward in modeling and understanding systems with **entwined micro-macro dynamics**. By explicitly incorporating **bidirectional feedback**, it provides a robust framework for studying the **emergent, adaptive, and non-equilibrium behaviors** that are hallmarks of complex systems. Its applications to ecology, economics, epidemiology, and thermodynamics exemplify its interdisciplinary relevance, making it a valuable tool for both theoretical exploration and practical problem-solving in cybernetics and beyond.
