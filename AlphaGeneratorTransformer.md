# Research Proposal: Intelligent Automated Discovery of Alpha Signals Using Large Language Models and Deep Learning

**1. Introduction**

The discovery of robust and predictive alpha signals is a core challenge in quantitative finance. Traditional methods for signal ideation often rely on expert knowledge, manual feature engineering, and time-consuming statistical validation. This research proposes a novel approach to automate and accelerate this process by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques, specifically transformer architectures, to learn the characteristics of effective financial signals and generate novel predictors of asset returns. This proposal builds upon recent advancements in natural language processing, code generation, and the application of deep learning to financial modeling.

**2. Problem Statement**

The current process of generating and validating financial signals is highly labor-intensive, requiring:

*   **Manual Feature Engineering:** Experts must painstakingly explore combinations of financial variables and transformations to identify potential signals.
*   **Limited Exploration:** Manual methods often explore a small subset of the possible search space, potentially missing valuable signals.
*   **Slow Iterative Process:** The validation and testing of each signal is a slow iterative process, restricting the speed of research.
*   **Expert Bias:** The process relies on a human expert, introducing bias in the signal generation and evaluation steps.

This research seeks to overcome these limitations by automating the entire signal ideation pipeline, using AI-driven methods to discover and validate new, statistically significant, and robust predictors of asset returns.

**3. Proposed Solution**

This research will develop an end-to-end system for the automated discovery of alpha signals by employing the following novel approach:

*   **Data Preparation:** The system will ingest historical data from COMPUSTAT, including a wide range of firm-level accounting variables, and corresponding market returns.
*   **Signal Representation:** Potential signals will be represented as sequences of tokens (numerical representations) that can be processed by transformer-based models. These representations can be:
    *   **Textual:** A textual description of the signal (variables, operators, lags, etc).
    *   **Code:** A code snippet (e.g., Python) defining how the signal is computed.
    *   **Combined:** A combination of text and code.
*   **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** The core of the system will be an encoder-decoder architecture based on transformer models:
    *   **Encoder:** The encoder will be a fine-tuned transformer model (e.g., based on BERT) trained on a large dataset of *encoded past financial signals*. These past signals will include successful and unsuccessful signals, with associated performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, statistical significance). The input to the encoder would be a sequence of tokens representing available COMPUSTAT variables, available mathematical operators, and potentially some context about the type of signal sought.
    *   **Decoder:** The decoder will generate new signals based on the encoder's output. This can generate new signals in:
        *   **Textual Format:** Generates a text description of the signal.
        *   **Code Format:** Generates code representing the signal.
*   **Fine-Tuning Tasks:** The encoder will be fine-tuned to perform one or several tasks, such as:
    *   **Signal Classification:** To predict whether a given signal (encoded as text/code) is likely to be a "good" or "bad" predictor.
    *   **Signal Ranking:** To rank a set of candidate signals based on their potential performance.
    *   **Signal Relevance:** To assess a signal's relevance to specific research questions.
    *   **Signal Explanation:** To generate human-readable explanations of why a signal is potentially useful.
*   **Statistical Validation and Filtering:** Generated signals will undergo rigorous statistical validation and robustness testing using methods similar to those employed in existing financial literature:
    *   Portfolio construction (equal-weighted and value-weighted).
    *   NYSE breakpoints.
    *   Risk-adjustment models.
    *   Correlation with known risk factors in the "factor zoo".
*   **Hybrid Approach (Optional):** If time and resources allow, we can experiment with a hybrid approach, using an LLM to rapidly generate a large set of candidate signals, followed by an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the most promising results further.

**4. Research Objectives**

The primary objectives of this research are:

*   **Develop an end-to-end system for the automated generation and evaluation of financial signals using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.**
*   **Train a transformer encoder to effectively extract the characteristics of effective financial signals from a dataset of past examples.**
*   **Train a decoder to generate novel and valid financial signals from available COMPUSTAT data and mathematical operators.**
*   **Evaluate the generated signals based on their statistical significance, robustness, and economic meaningfulness.**
*   **Compare the performance of the system with traditional methods of signal ideation.**
*   **Investigate the potential for LLMs to explain the logic behind the generated signals.**

**5. Research Methodology**

The research will follow these key methodological steps:

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collect and clean historical financial data from COMPUSTAT.
2.  **Signal Representation and Encoding:** Define and implement techniques for representing potential financial signals as tokenized input sequences for the transformer model.
3.  **Fine-tuning the Encoder:** Fine-tune the transformer encoder on past signals and performance metrics, using multiple fine-tuning tasks described above.
4.  **Training the Decoder:** Train a decoder to generate new signals from the encoder's output.
5.  **System Integration and Evaluation:** Integrate the encoder-decoder with a validation and evaluation pipeline.
6.  **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate and compare the system's performance against traditional methods, measuring accuracy, robustness, and novelty of the generated signals.

**6. Expected Outcomes**
