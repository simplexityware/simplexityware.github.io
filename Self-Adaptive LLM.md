# **Research Proposal: Boosting Gemini 2.0 for Multi-Agent Fine-Tuning**

## **1. Introduction**
Your current research proposal, **Multiagent Fine-Tuning MVP 2.0**, introduces a novel framework for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) through **multi-agent fine-tuning**. The framework leverages multiple LLMs that engage in **debate and consensus mechanisms** to enhance reasoning, diversity, and task-specific performance. While this approach has shown promise, the performance of the multi-agent system is inherently tied to the capabilities of the **foundational model** (Gemini 2.0). 

To further enhance this framework, we propose **boosting the foundational model (Gemini 2.0)** using **Singular Value Fine-tuning (SVF)** and **self-adaptation strategies** before engaging in multi-agent fine-tuning. This approach will create a more capable base model, enabling the multi-agent system to achieve higher performance with fewer computational resources. By integrating the **Transformer²** methodology, we aim to address the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods and improve the adaptability of the foundational model.

3. **Integrate into Multi-Agent Fine-Tuning**:
   - Use the boosted Gemini 2.0 as the foundational model for multi-agent fine-tuning, as outlined in your current proposal.
   - Fine-tune individual agents using SVF or other parameter-efficient methods to specialize them further for specific sub-tasks.

4. **Optimize for Resource Constraints**:
   - Adapt the methodology for Google Colab, ensuring feasibility within its computational and memory limitations.

## **3. Methodology**

### **3.1 Boosting Gemini 2.0**
#### **3.1.1 Singular Value Fine-tuning (SVF)**
- **Objective**: Specialize Gemini 2.0 for specific tasks by fine-tuning only the singular values of its weight matrices.
- **Implementation**:
  - Extract the singular values of Gemini 2.0's weight matrices using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.
  - Train task-specific "expert" vectors using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** on small datasets (e.g., GSM8K for math reasoning, MBPP for coding).
  - Use the **REINFORCE algorithm** with a **KL divergence penalty** to optimize task performance while regularizing the model.
- **Outcome**: A more capable and task-specialized version of Gemini 2.0.

#### **3.1.2 Self-Adaptation Strategies**
- **Objective**: Enable Gemini 2.0 to dynamically adapt to new tasks during inference.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Two-Pass Inference**:
    - **First Pass**: Use a lightweight classifier or prompt-based method to identify the task type.
    - **Second Pass**: Combine the expert vectors dynamically based on the task identified in the first pass.
  - **Adaptation Strategies**:
    - **Prompt-Based**: Construct a prompt to ask the model to categorize the input task and select the corresponding expert vector.
    - **Classification-Based**: Fine-tune a classification expert using SVF to improve task identification.
    - **Few-Shot Adaptation**: Use a small number of examples (e.g., 3-5) to interpolate between expert vectors using the **Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**.
- **Outcome**: A self-adaptive Gemini 2.0 model that can handle a wide range of tasks dynamically.

### **3.2 Multi-Agent Fine-Tuning**
Building on your current proposal, we integrate the boosted Gemini 2.0 into the **multi-agent fine-tuning framework**:

#### **3.2.1 Initialization**
- Use the boosted Gemini 2.0 as the foundational model for all agents in the multi-agent system.
- Each agent is initialized with the same base model but fine-tuned for specific sub-tasks.

#### **3.2.2 Fine-Tuning Individual Agents**
- Fine-tune each agent using **SVF** or other parameter-efficient methods (e.g., LoRA) to specialize them further for specific sub-tasks.
- Use small, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MBPP, or ARC).

#### **3.2.3 Multi-Agent Debate and Consensus**
- Agents engage in a **debate process**, generating responses and critiquing each other, as described in your current proposal.
- The final response is determined by **majority voting** or a consensus mechanism.
- Use **summarization** to combine insights from multiple agents, improving the quality of the final output.

### **3.3 Adaptations for Google Colab**
To ensure feasibility within Google Colab's constraints:
- **Use Smaller Models**: If Gemini 2.0 is too large, use a smaller variant or a distilled version of the model.
- **Reduce Dataset Size**: Use smaller subsets of datasets (e.g., 1,000 samples from GSM8K) for fine-tuning and evaluation.
- **Layer Reduction**: Apply SVF to only a subset of layers (e.g., the last 6 layers) to reduce computational overhead.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Use FP16 to reduce memory usage and speed up training.
- **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting and save training time.
