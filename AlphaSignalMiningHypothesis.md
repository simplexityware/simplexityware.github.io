**Research Proposal: Enhanced Autonomous Financial Signal Mining through Domain-Specific Large Language Models**

**1. Introduction**

This research project proposes to investigate and replicate the capabilities of the QuantAgent framework for autonomous financial signal mining, by exploring the use of a domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM), specifically FinText, as its base language model. Existing research (as detailed in the QuantAgent paper) demonstrates the potential of autonomous agents for financial analysis, but relies on general-purpose LLMs. This research aims to validate the effectiveness of these agents by using a financial-specific LLM and rigorously testing its capabilities against previously published results and to also examine and evaluate the limitations of using a general-purpose LLM, or using the FinText LLM as a baseline model.

**2. Background and Literature Review**

This project will build upon two key bodies of research:

*   **Autonomous Agents for Financial Analysis:** This stream of work, as exemplified by the QuantAgent paper, explores the development of autonomous systems using LLMs for complex tasks like financial signal generation, and demonstrates that these agents can self-improve through interaction with feedback loops.
*   **Domain-Specific LLMs in Finance:** The FinText paper (Re(Visiting) Large Language Models in Finance) demonstrates that LLMs pre-trained on financial data outperform general-purpose models in tasks such as financial language understanding, highlighting the potential benefits of domain-specific expertise.
* **Limitations of Existing Work** Both the QuantAgent and FinText papers leave open questions regarding replicability, computational resource limitations, and model performance. This study seeks to address these challenges by performing a replication study.

**3. Research Questions and Hypothesis**

This research aims to address the following questions:

1.  Can a domain-specific LLM (FinText) demonstrably enhance the quality, convergence rate, efficiency, and robustness against bias of an autonomous agent (QuantAgent) for financial signal mining, compared to using a general-purpose LLM as its base?
2.  Can the QuantAgent system, when combined with a domain-specific LLM, achieve self-improvement through the described iterative framework in a realistic financial trading environment?
3.  What are the performance differences, especially as it relates to computational complexity, between using FinText and other LLMs as the base model?

**Hypothesis:**

We hypothesize that by integrating a domain-specific LLM (specifically, FinText) into the QuantAgent framework, we will achieve a more effective and efficient system for autonomous financial signal mining. Specifically:

1.  **Enhanced Signal Quality:** FinText will allow the agent to generate higher quality financial signals (as measured by IC, Sharpe ratio, novelty, and alignment with trading ideas) as compared with other LLMs.
2.  **Improved Convergence:** FinText will lead to faster convergence within the agent's iterative learning loops as compared with other LLMs.
3.  **Reduced Prompt Engineering:** FinText's domain-specific knowledge will lower prompt complexity as compared with other LLMs.
4.  **Robustness Against Look-Ahead Bias:** The system will exhibit more robust defense against look-ahead bias as compared with LLMs that do not have the same pretraining.
5. **Practical Implementation:** This model can be implemented with publicly available data and infrastructure.

**4. Methodology**

This research project will employ a mixed-methods approach involving:

1.  **Replication of QuantAgent:** We will start by implementing the QuantAgent framework, following the structure and processes outlined in the original paper. This will include setting up the two-loop system (inner reasoning loop, outer environment loop) and the knowledge base. We will also generate initial trading ideas using prompts designed to elicit diverse outputs.
2.  **Integration of FinText:** We will replace the generic LLM in QuantAgent with the FinText models (base and small variants) provided by the FinText paper. We will leverage the pre-trained model as a *feature extractor* and also as a base model for generating signal implementations. We will also utilize FinText as a judge for evaluating the validity of produced signals.
3.  **Comparative Evaluation:**
    *   **Signal Quality:** We will measure the quality of the generated financial signals using Information Coefficient (IC), Sharpe ratios, as well as a qualitative assessment of their alignment with the original trading ideas, as well as their novelty.
    *   **Convergence:** We will measure the convergence rate of the iterative loops by assessing the number of loop iterations necessary to improve performance metrics as compared with other LLMs.
    *   **Prompt Complexity:** We will compare the number and detail of prompt modifications that were needed to generate the same outputs using FinText, versus other LLMs that are not financial specific.
    *   **Look-Ahead Bias:** We will explicitly test for look-ahead bias by training the LLM using past datasets and comparing the results against testing datasets that the model was trained on.
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** We will measure and compare the time it takes for model training, inference, and data processing for FinText versus other LLMs.
4.  **Data:** We will attempt to use the same or similar datasets as the original papers to evaluate our results. This will include:
    *   Chinese A-Share market data (QuantAgent paper)
    *   Financial news data, company filings, financial transcripts, Wikipedia, and board information data as detailed in the FinText paper (from 2007-2023).
5.  **Benchmarking:** We will compare the performance of QuantAgent with FinText against the following:
    *   QuantAgent implemented with a general purpose LLM, such as gpt-4-0125-preview.
    *   Baselines from the QuantAgent paper and the FinText paper (Llama, LMD, etc).
    *   Direct baselines from real-world market data.
6.  **Analysis:** We will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze our results. Specifically we will:
    * Analyze performance statistics, both with and without transaction costs, to measure the effectiveness of QuantAgent on the various baselines.
    * Conduct a sensitivity analysis of the impact of prompt design on the generated outputs and on the models' performance.

**5. Expected Outcomes**

This project is expected to:

1.  Provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of a domain-specific LLM (FinText) in an autonomous financial signal mining framework (QuantAgent).
2.  Produce a replicable implementation of the QuantAgent framework that uses a domain-specific LLM, making that implementation available for the community to use.
3.  Identify limitations and advantages of different LLMs in this context, which can provide direction for future research.
4.  Generate insights into the specific aspects of the LLM that contributes to a successful financial signal mining system.

**6. Timeline**

The research project is anticipated to take approximately 6-8 months. This includes time for:

*   Literature review and setup: (1 Month)
*   Implementation of the QuantAgent framework and dataset collection: (2 months)
*   Integration of FinText and Comparative analysis: (3 months)
*   Writing and Final Report Submission: (1-2 month)

**7. Resources**

The project will require:

*   Access to computational resources (GPUs) to train and test LLM models.
*   Programming environment and data processing tools (Python, PyTorch, Pandas).
*   Access to required datasets from publicly available sources.

**8. Conclusion**

This research project will contribute to the field of autonomous financial systems by explicitly integrating a domain-specific LLM into a robust self-improving framework. This project will also address important gaps in the existing literature, specifically by examining the practical application of a domain-specific language model in an agent framework, exploring its potential as well as its limitations. This study will provide a clear and thorough empirical analysis of both these papers, and will provide valuable insights into how these types of systems can be used in real-world scenarios.
