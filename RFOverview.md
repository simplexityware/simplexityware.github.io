This document is an overview of reinforcement learning (RL), a field concerned with methods for solving sequential decision-making problems. The paper covers a broad range of topics in RL, including:

**1. Introduction**
*   **Sequential decision making:** Defining the basic RL problem, where an agent interacts with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
*   **Canonical examples:** Introducing partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), MDPs, contextual MDPs, contextual bandits, belief state MDPs, and how optimization problems can be seen as a special case of RL.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Categorizing RL methods based on whether they are value-based, policy-based, or model-based, and discussing how to deal with partial observability.
*   **Exploration-exploitation tradeoff:** Highlighting the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration (learning about the environment) and exploitation (acting to maximize immediate rewards). Discusses simple heuristics like epsilon-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, as well as more advanced methods like upper confidence bounds (UCBs) and Thompson sampling.
*   **RL as a posterior inference problem:** Presents an alternative view of RL as an inference problem, where the goal is to infer a policy that maximizes the probability of achieving high rewards. This perspective leads to methods like maximum entropy RL and active inference.

**2. Value-based RL**
*   **Basic concepts:** Defining value functions, Q-functions, and advantage functions, and deriving Bellman's equations.
*   **Computing the value function and policy given a known world model:** Discussing value iteration, real-time dynamic programming (RTDP), and policy iteration.
*   **Computing the value function without knowing the world model:** Introducing Monte Carlo estimation, temporal difference (TD) learning, eligibility traces, and SARSA.
*   **Q-learning:** Describing tabular Q-learning and Q-learning with function approximation, including neural fitted Q and DQN. Discusses challenges like experience replay, the deadly triad, target networks, and maximization bias, and presents solutions like double Q-learning.
*   **DQN extensions:** Reviewing various extensions to DQN, including Q-learning for continuous actions, dueling DQN, noisy nets, multi-step DQN, and Rainbow.

**3. Policy-based RL**
*   **The policy gradient theorem:** Deriving the fundamental theorem for policy gradient methods.
*   **REINFORCE:** Introducing the REINFORCE algorithm and discussing the use of baselines to reduce variance.
*   **Actor-critic methods:** Describing advantage actor-critic (A2C), generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and two-time scale actor-critic algorithms.
*   **Policy improvement methods:** Discussing trust region policy optimization (TRPO), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and VMPO.
*   **Off-policy methods:** Introducing importance sampling for policy evaluation and describing off-policy actor-critic methods, including V-trace and IMPALA.
*   **Soft actor-critic (SAC):** Presenting the SAC algorithm, which combines off-policy learning with maximum entropy RL.
*   **Deterministic policy gradient methods:** Describing DDPG and TD3.

**4. Model-based RL**
*   **Decision-time planning:** Discussing model predictive control (MPC), heuristic search, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), and trajectory optimization.
*   **Background planning:** Introducing Dyna and discussing how to deal with model errors and uncertainty.
*   **World models:** Describing different types of world models, including generative models (observation-space, factored, latent-space, Dreamer, Iris) and non-generative models (value prediction, self-prediction, policy prediction, observation prediction, BYOL-Explore).
*   **Beyond one-step models:** Discussing general value functions, successor representations, successor models, successor features, and generalized policy improvement.

**5. Other topics in RL**
*   **Distributional RL:** Discussing methods that learn a distribution over returns rather than just the expected return.
*   **Reward functions:** Highlighting the challenges of reward hacking, sparse rewards, and reward shaping.
*   **Hierarchical RL:** Introducing feudal (goal-conditioned) HRL and the options framework.
*   **Imitation learning:** Describing behavior cloning and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL).
*   **Offline RL:** Discussing the challenges of learning from a fixed dataset and presenting various approaches, including policy constraint methods, uncertainty penalties, conservative Q-learning, and offline RL using reward-conditioned sequence modeling.
*   **LLMs and RL:** Exploring the connections between large language models (LLMs) and RL, including using RL to fine-tune LLMs, using LLMs to pre-process inputs for RL, using LLMs for reward functions, using LLMs as world models, and using LLMs as policies.
*   **General RL, AIXI and universal AGI:** Briefly discussing the general RL setting and its connection to the theoretical concept of AIXI and artificial general intelligence (AGI).
