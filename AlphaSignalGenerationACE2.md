**Research Proposal: Automated Alpha Signal Generation using a Transformer Architecture and the Alpha Creation Environment (ACE)**

**1. Introduction**

This research proposes a novel approach to automated alpha signal generation for quantitative trading. We aim to develop a system that can automatically discover, evaluate, and refine trading signals (alphas) by leveraging a dual-encoder transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model in conjunction with a comprehensive simulation and execution environment (ACE). This system will address the challenges of manually designing and testing alpha signals by automating and accelerating the discovery process.

**2. Background and Motivation**

*   **Alpha Signal Complexity:** Modern quantitative trading relies on complex alpha signals derived from diverse datasets and sophisticated combinations of operators. Manually creating and testing these signals is time-consuming and requires specialized domain expertise.
*   **Need for Automation:** There is a growing need for automated systems that can efficiently explore vast signal spaces, discover novel alphas, and adapt to changing market conditions.
*   **Transformer Architectures:** Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance in sequence-to-sequence tasks. Their ability to capture long-range dependencies and complex relationships makes them well-suited for generating alpha signal expressions.
*   **Simulation Environments:** Simulation environments, like the ACE, provide the means to realistically evaluate the viability of an alpha signal. These evaluations provide crucial feedback for the training process.
* **Need to Capture Financial Semantics:** The generated alphas need to capture financial concepts and contexts from a variety of sources in order to be considered viable and useful.

**3. Research Objectives**

The core objectives of this research are:

1.  **Develop a Dual-Encoder Transformer-Based Alpha Generator:**
    *   Design a dual-encoder architecture, using a custom transformer model based on the `ModernBERT` implementation for alpha expressions and the pre-trained `FinText` model for financial text.
    *   Implement an input representation that encodes metadata of datafields, constraints, seed expressions, or textual descriptions of alpha signals, and a second input representation that encodes financial text documents.
    *   Develop a module for combining the outputs of both encoders using concatenation, cross-attention, or a fusion layer.
    *   Implement a decoder that generates valid alpha signal expressions using the defined grammar.
2.  **Integrate with the Alpha Creation Environment (ACE):**
    *   Utilize the ACE as a data source to generate a large and diverse set of alpha expressions, along with simulation results.
    *   Use the ACE as an environment to evaluate the viability of generated alphas, obtaining performance metrics such as fitness, sharpe, IS test results etc.
    *   Use the ACE as a tool for alpha refinement, allowing the transformer to learn to adapt to market conditions.
3.  **Training and Evaluation Methodology:**
    *   Train the transformer model using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, using the ACE as an external evaluation loop.
    *   Evaluate the model based on its ability to generate novel, viable alpha signals that pass defined thresholds and demonstrate performance as assessed by the ACE.
    *   Compare the performance of the generated alphas to a baseline of manually created alphas.
4.  **System Extensibility:**
    *   Design the system to be extensible, allowing for new data sources, new operators, and custom simulation settings to be readily integrated.

**4. Proposed Approach**

We will employ the following approach:

1.  **Formalize Alpha Signal Grammar:** Develop a formal grammar defining the syntax of valid alpha signal expressions (as we've already done).
2.  **Develop Input Representations:** Create an appropriate input format for the transformer encoders, capable of encoding alpha signal metadata, constraints, seed expressions, and also capable of encoding financial documents.
3.  **Implement Dual-Encoder Architecture:** Implement the architecture using a transformer based on `ModernBERT` for the alpha expression encoder, and the pre-trained FinText model for the financial document encoder.
4.  **Implement Fusion Strategy:** Build a module to combine the outputs of both encoders, testing concatenation, attention-based and a fusion layer to test the different methods.
5.  **Data Generation from ACE and Financial Documents:** Leverage the ACE to generate a training dataset consisting of a diverse set of alpha signal expressions, along with their corresponding evaluation metrics from simulations, and also obtain various documents from the financial domain.
6.  **Training with Supervised and Reinforcement Learning:**
    *   Pre-train the transformer with a supervised learning approach using labeled data, and then fine tune the model using a reinforcement learning approach, using ACE metrics as rewards and penalties.
7.  **Iterative Refinement Loop:** Set up an iterative loop where generated alphas are evaluated in the ACE, and this feedback is used to update the transformer model, enabling continuous improvement.
8.  **Evaluation and Validation:** Evaluate the system on a set of held-out alpha expressions to assess the generalization capabilities of the model and compare against benchmarked human-designed alphas.
9.  **System Refinement:** Continuously refine the system based on the performance of generated alphas, paying particular attention to improving viability, performance, and interpretability.

**5. High-Level System Architecture:**

Our proposed system employs a dual-encoder architecture, followed by a decoder, which is described below.

*   **Alpha Expression Encoder:**
    *   **Base Model:** A custom transformer model based on the modular `ModernBERT` framework.
    *   **Input:** Tokenized alpha signal expressions (sequences of data variables, operators, and parentheses).
    *   **Output:** A vector representation of the alpha expression's structure and semantics in a latent space.
*   **Financial Document Encoder:**
    *   **Pre-trained Model:** The pre-trained FinText model accessed through the HuggingFace Transformers library.
    *   **Input:** Tokenized financial text documents (e.g., news articles, earnings reports, etc.).
    *   **Output:** A vector representation of the financial text, containing contextualized embeddings.
*    **Combination Module**
    *  Combines the vector representation output from the Alpha Expression Encoder, and the Financial Document Encoder.
    *  This is done using a concatenation, cross-attention, or a linear fusion layer.
    *   **Output**: A combined vector representation.
*   **Alpha Expression Decoder:**
    *   **Base Model:** A standard transformer decoder model.
    *   **Input:** The combined vector representation from the Combination Module, plus the output of the decoder itself as well as the hidden states.
    *   **Output:** A tokenized sequence that corresponds to a new alpha expression.
*  **Alpha Validation**
   * Takes the generated tokens and makes sure the resulting alpha expression is valid according to the grammar.
*   **ACE Integration:**
    *   Generated alpha expressions are sent to the ACE simulation environment for evaluation.
    *   ACE provides feedback, including simulation metrics such as fitness scores, Sharpe ratios, and IS tests.
*  **Reinforcement Learning Engine**
   * Uses the ACE simulation metrics to provide a reward or penalty.
   * Uses the reward or penalty for reinforcement learning during training.

**6. Expected Outcomes**

*   A working automated system capable of generating novel and viable alpha signals.
*   A well-trained dual-encoder transformer model that effectively captures both the syntax and semantics of valid alpha expressions, as well as the financial context from documents.
