**Research Proposal: Multi-Agent Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models in Google Colab**

**1. Introduction**

This research proposal outlines a plan to investigate the viability of multi-agent fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) within the constrained environment of Google Colab, using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API. Multi-agent fine-tuning, as described in the paper "MultiAgent FineTuning: Self Improvement with Diverse Reasoning Chains," offers a promising approach to enhance LLM performance by encouraging specialization and diversification of reasoning through multiple interacting agents. This approach contrasts with traditional single-agent fine-tuning methods, which can suffer from diminishing returns and lack of diversity in generated responses. Our research will focus on developing a minimal viable product (MVP) that replicates the core concepts of multi-agent fine-tuning in the restrictive environment of Google Colab.

**2. Research Questions**

This research aims to answer the following primary question:

*   **Primary Question:** Can the multi-agent fine-tuning methodology, specifically designed for self-improvement of LLMs, be successfully replicated within the resource-constrained environment of Google Colab, using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API?

To address the primary question, we will explore the following sub-questions:

*   **Sub-question 1:** Can the Gemini 2.0 Flash API be effectively utilized within a Colab environment to implement a multi-agent system involving multiple LLMs acting as generator and critic agents?
*   **Sub-question 2:** Can a single iteration of multi-agent fine-tuning, using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API, produce a demonstrable improvement in model accuracy on a small set of mathematical reasoning tasks, compared to the base model?
*  **Sub-question 3:** Can we create a modular and flexible system that can be easily adapted to more agents, iterations, and complex datasets, building on the results of the MVP?

**3. Research Goals**

Our research goals are divided into three phases:

*   **Phase 1: Core MVP (Immediate Goal)**

    *   **Goal 1:** Implement a minimal viable product (MVP) in a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates a single iteration of the multi-agent fine-tuning process using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API.
    *   **Goal 2:** Successfully load and preprocess a small subset (100 training, 20 evaluation examples) of the MATH dataset for use in the multi-agent system.
    *   **Goal 3:** Establish a multi-agent interaction loop where two generator agents and one critic agent iteratively solve math problems.
    *  **Goal 4:** Implement a simplified grading mechanism based on string matching to assess the correctness of generated answers.
    *   **Goal 5:** Fine-tune the generator and critic agents using training data that highlights each agent's respective specialization.
    *   **Goal 6:** Demonstrate an improvement in accuracy of either the critic or generator agents in a held-out set of examples using the string based metric, compared to the performance of the base model, after a single iteration of the multiagent training process.
    *   **Goal 7:**  Ensure that the core process is replicable with the same dataset, model, and hyper parameters.
*   **Phase 2: Intermediate Goals**
    *   **Goal 8:** Add the summarization step to the multi-agent interaction process.
    *   **Goal 9:** Increase the number of agents involved in the debate.
    *   **Goal 10:** Increase the number of rounds of debate in the interaction process.
    *   **Goal 11:** Develop a more robust grading method using symbolic evaluation with the `sympy` library and adapt the existing `grader.py` script for use in the Colab environment, to handle mathematical expressions.
    *   **Goal 12:** Test and report different hyper parameters.
*   **Phase 3: Long-Term Goals**
    *   **Goal 13:** Expand the experiment to include a larger subset of the MATH dataset.
    *  **Goal 14:** Explore zero-shot generalization capabilities using different subsets of the MATH dataset, and test on new datasets.
    *  **Goal 15:** Investigate the impact of different diversity metrics such as negative log-likelihood and embedding dissimilarity.
    *   **Goal 16:** Fully replicate the entire methodology from the original paper using Gemini 2.0 Flash API in a Google Colab environment.

**4. Methodology**

*   **Data:** We will use a subset of the MATH dataset from Hugging Face (`deepmind/math_dataset`), starting with a small number of examples for the MVP (`arithmetic__add_or_sub` module).
*   **Models:** We will use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp`) through the Google Gen AI SDK.
*   **Multi-Agent Interaction:** We will implement a multi-agent debate using two generator agents and one critic agent, with a single round of debate in the MVP phase.
*   **Fine-Tuning:** We will fine-tune the generator and critic models using the Gemini API, and training data derived from the multi-agent interaction.
*   **Evaluation:** We will assess the model performance using a simplified string-matching-based accuracy for the MVP, which can be expanded to a more robust grading using the `grader.py` logic with `sympy` in later iterations.
*   **Implementation Environment:** All code will be executed in a Google Colab notebook with GPU acceleration.

**5. Expected Outcomes**

*   **MVP Success:** We expect to demonstrate that a multi-agent fine-tuning process can be successfully implemented in Colab using Gemini 2.0 Flash, and that we can observe a demonstrable improvement using even a single iteration of the multiagent training process.
*   **Viable Workflow:** The core multi-agent loop, fine-tuning, and evaluation workflow is expected to be functional and adaptable.
*   **Scalability Path:** This MVP implementation will serve as a foundation for expanding the experiment to larger datasets, more complex tasks, and multiple iterations of the fine-tuning process.
*  **Code Base:** The code base is designed to be modular and documented, enabling more complex experiments in the future.

**6. Timeline**

*   **Phase 1 (MVP):** 2 weeks
*   **Phase 2 (Intermediate Goals):** 2-4 weeks
*   **Phase 3 (Long-Term Goals):** 4-8 weeks (depending on results of previous phases)

**7. Resources**

*   Google Colab Pro+ subscription for access to GPU resources.
*   Google Gen AI SDK, Hugging Face Datasets library
*   Gemini 2.0 Flash API access.

**8. Evaluation Metrics**

*   **MVP:** String matching based accuracy on the held out dataset.
*  **Intermediate and Long Term:** String based accuracy, and `sympy` based accuracy.
*  **Diversity Metrics:** Negative Log Likelihood, Embedding Dissimilarity, Consensus.

**10. Conclusion**

This research proposal outlines a focused plan to demonstrate the viability of multi-agent fine-tuning within the Google Colab environment. By achieving this MVP, we will lay a solid foundation for exploring the full potential of this approach and contribute to the development of more robust and diverse LLMs using publicly available tools. The modular design of the code base, and the use of a string based accuracy for the MVP should ensure rapid development for the first stage, and enable more complex experiments later.
