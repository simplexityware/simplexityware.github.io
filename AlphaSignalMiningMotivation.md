**Our Overall Hypothesis:**

We hypothesize that by integrating a domain-specific LLM (specifically, FinText) into the QuantAgent framework, we will achieve a demonstrably more effective and efficient system for autonomous financial signal mining, characterized by:

1.  **Enhanced Signal Quality:** The integration of FinText will enable the QuantAgent to generate higher quality financial signals, as measured by predictive accuracy (e.g., Information Coefficient - IC, Sharpe Ratio), novelty, and alignment with underlying trading ideas, compared to using a general-purpose LLM as the base LLM.
2.  **Improved Convergence:** The use of FinText will lead to a more efficient and faster convergence within the QuantAgent's iterative learning loops (both inner and outer loops), as its enhanced understanding of the financial domain should improve both its signal generation as well as its evaluation capabilities within those loops.
3.  **Reduced Prompt Engineering Overhead:** Leveraging FinText's pre-existing financial knowledge will reduce the need for overly complex and detailed prompts, making it easier to guide the agent and reducing the need to manually fine-tune prompting approaches.
4.  **Robustness against Look-Ahead Bias:** QuantAgent using FinText (and its historical pretraining) as the base LLM will exhibit a more robust defense against look-ahead bias. It will produce more accurate historical simulations of trading strategies by drawing on information that would only be available at the specific time frame being evaluated.
5. **Practical Implementation:** The model should be able to be implemented with readily available technology and data.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Hypothesis:**

*   **Part 1: LLM Integration.**
    *   We posit that replacing a general purpose LLM (such as gpt-4-0125-preview, used in the QuantAgent paper) with FinText, a specialized financial LLM, will result in a better system.
    *   We specifically hypothesize that the domain-specific pre-training of FinText will lead to an improvement in signal quality, convergence, prompt engineering overhead, and robustness against bias.
*   **Part 2: Evaluation of Specific Outcomes.**
    *   **Signal Quality:** We will evaluate signal quality using multiple measures. This includes comparing the predictive power of FinText generated signals and gpt-4 generated signals. We will also evaluate the relevance of the produced signals with their intended trading ideas. Finally we will evaluate other properties of those signals, such as uniqueness and validity.
    *   **Convergence Rate:** We will compare how efficiently QuantAgent converges to an improved set of signals with FinText versus other LLMs, specifically evaluating how long the inner and outer loops take to settle on a good trading strategy based on some performance metric.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** We will compare the level of prompt detail and iterative prompt modifications that are necessary to get effective signals from FinText vs. a general-purpose LLM. We specifically hypothesize that the specialized LLM will require less modifications and less detailed initial prompts to get the same output.
    *   **Look-Ahead Bias Robustness:** We will explicitly test whether FinText maintains a low level of look-ahead bias when used to generate signals and evaluate them, especially as it relates to historical trading simulations by comparing against models that utilize data that it should not have access to.
    *   **Practical Implementation:** Finally we hypothesize that both datasets required for this framework are accessible to the public, and the overall implementation can be done with widely available hardware and programming languages.

**What We Set Out to Prove:**

Our replication exercise aims to provide evidence that the following are true:

1.  **FinText is a Superior Base LLM:** Using FinText as the base LLM for QuantAgent leads to demonstrably better outcomes compared to using a general-purpose LLM by testing the hypothesis outlined above.
2.  **Framework Effectiveness:** That QuantAgent framework can achieve self-improvement by iteratively improving performance on realistic simulated financial trading tasks.
3.  **Practicality of the Approach:** We can validate that the QuantAgent framework built with FinText LLMs is implementable with reasonably available data and computational resources.

**How This Hypothesis Guides Our Work:**

This hypothesis helps us:

*   **Focus our efforts:** It provides specific metrics and comparisons to guide our replication efforts.
*   **Structure the analysis:** It informs how we analyze the data and draw conclusions.
*   **Interpret the results:** It helps us understand if our replication attempt has been successful, as well as interpret any limitations and differences with the original papers.

This clear hypothesis will be crucial for guiding our efforts as we delve into the details of trying to replicate both of these papers.
